included
--------------------------------------------

   (fork of fitter.py from my other repo:python-learning.  development will now take place here.)

to do
--------------------------------------------
0. This page and the wiki are severly out of date, but there have been a lot of structural changes recently.  I will update this with better explanations when the code becomes more stable (or when portions are better checked for correctness).
1. Someone needs to check the results with new data.
